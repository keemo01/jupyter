## Introduction

Hello my name is Akeem Jokosenumi and this is my Graph theory project I made for my summer repeats the point of this notebook is to show what I've learnt over the summer and during the module.

## Graph theory

In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in discrete mathematics.


## Heap Sort and Graph Isomorphism problem

### Graph Isomorphism problem
 
The Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem asks to determine whether two given graphs are isomorphic. It is known that graphs are universal among explicit nite structures in the sense that the isomorphism problem for explicit structures can be reduced in polynomial time to GI.

In this notebook contains the following:

• Definition of graph isomorphism.
• Specification of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
• Python function to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic.
• Explanation of the main reason computer scientists are interested in the complexity of
the Graph Isomorphism Problem

### Heap sort
Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.

In this notebook contains the following:

• Explanation of what a rooted binary tree is.
• Overview of how the heap sort algorithm works, with reference to trees.
• Python function implementing Heap Sort.
• Explanation why, in the worst case, heap sort is more efficient than bubble sort.
